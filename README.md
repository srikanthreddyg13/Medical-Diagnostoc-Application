# Medical-Diagnostoc-Application

Our project aims to build a medical diagnostic application which documents the ongoing active patient’s medical records 
in addition to keeping a track and record of each patient’s previous medical test history across lab organizations. 
Thus, making it easy for the patients to access and share records via a single application to multiple hospitals/doctors/laboratories.
